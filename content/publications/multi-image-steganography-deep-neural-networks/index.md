abstract: Steganography is the science of hiding a secret message within an ordinary public message. Over the years, steganography has been used to encode a lower resolution image into a higher resolution image by simple methods like LSB manipulation. We aim to utilize deep neural networks for the encoding and decoding of multiple secret images inside a single cover image of the same resolution.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A deep learning approach for encoding and decoding multiple secret images inside a single cover image of the same resolution.

Steganography is the science of hiding a secret message within an ordinary public message. We utilize deep neural networks for the encoding and decoding of multiple secret images inside a single cover image of the same resolution.

## Key Contributions

- Deep learning-based approach for multi-image steganography
- Encoding and decoding of multiple secret images within a single cover image
- Same resolution preservation for cover and secret images
