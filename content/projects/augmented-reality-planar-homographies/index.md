## Creating a real-time Augmented Reality Application

> Rendering video on a moving target
{{< video src="ar_c.mp4" controls="yes" >}}

I have tracked the book in each frame in the target video and overlayed each frame of the source video onto the book in the target video.

> Source video
{{< video src="ar_source_c.mp4" controls="yes" >}}

> Target video
{{< video src="book_c.mp4" controls="yes" >}}
